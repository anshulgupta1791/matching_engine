This project is a Python-based test automation framework designed to interact with web applications using Selenium WebDriver. The framework is structured to support various testing needs, including smoke tests and feature-specific tests.

### Key Components

1. **Test Files**:
   - `test_repertoire_management.py`: Contains test cases for verifying the "Products Supported" section under the "Repertoire Management" module. It uses pytest for test execution and parameterization.

2. **Fixtures**:
   - `conftest.py`: Defines pytest fixtures for setting up the test environment. The `basic_setup` fixture initializes the `FEGeneral` class and opens the browser, while the `products_supported` fixture sets up the environment for testing the "Products Supported" feature.

3. **Utility Classes**:
   - `FEGeneral`: Provides general utility methods for interacting with a web browser, such as opening and closing the browser, navigating to URLs, and interacting with web elements.
   - `MatchingEngineHome`: Extends `FEGeneral` to provide specific methods for interacting with the Matching Engine Home page, such as navigating to the home page, clicking header options, and verifying the "Products Supported" section.

4. **Configuration Files**:
   - `matching_engine_home_config.py`: Contains configuration data for locating and interacting with elements on the Matching Engine Home page.
   - `matching_engine_home_data.yaml`: Stores XPath locators and other configuration data used by `MatchingEngineHomeConfig`.

5. **Test Configuration**:
   - `pytest.ini`: Configures pytest settings, such as specifying test file patterns and defining custom markers for test categorization.

6. **Dependencies**:
   - `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required for the project, including pytest, selenium, and other utilities.

### How It Works

- **Setup**: The `basic_setup` fixture initializes the `FEGeneral` class and opens a Chrome browser. This fixture is used across tests to ensure a consistent test environment.
- **Test Execution**: Tests are defined using pytest and can be parameterized to run with different inputs. The `products_supported` fixture sets up the environment for specific tests by navigating to the required page and performing necessary actions.
- **Browser Interaction**: The `FEGeneral` class provides methods to interact with the browser, such as opening URLs, finding elements, and clicking elements. The `MatchingEngineHome` class extends these capabilities with methods specific to the Matching Engine Home page.
- **Assertions**: Tests include assertions to verify that the expected elements and text are present on the page, ensuring that the application behaves as expected.

This framework provides a robust and flexible structure for automating web application tests, ensuring that the application functions correctly across different scenarios and configurations.
